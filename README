This repository is for code written to scrape data from various websites for Bright Bytes' Labs and to inform the Bright Bytes online Clarity platform.
I am adding it to Github in order to keep it organized.

relevant:
pub_priv.rb -> currently iowa specific; prints out all of the following fields for all of the zip codes in iowa. to make this reusable, change the array to a different array of zip codes.
	prints: NCES id, name, type, phone number, minimum grade, maximum grade, zip code

obsolete:
nces_ids.rb -> ARGV[0]: state code
ARGV[1] -> number of pages
gets all NCES ids for a state's public schools

schools_from_ids.rb -> not currently reusable; initial array must be changed so that the NCES ids are the schools that you get demographic data for; probably going to have to rewrite this one totally to pull from a site that has public AND private
